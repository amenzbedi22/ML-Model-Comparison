# 🧠 Machine Learning Model Comparison

This project compares the performance of several popular machine learning algorithms on a dataset using Python.  
The models are trained, evaluated, and compared based on their accuracy and other performance metrics.

## 🎯 Educational Purpose

 🧩 **Note:**  
 This repository is created **for learning and educational purposes**.  
 It demonstrates how to preprocess data, train models, evaluate performance, and visualize results in Python using open-source libraries.


## 📘 Project Overview

The notebook **`project.ipynb`** includes:
- Data preprocessing and exploration  
- Feature scaling and encoding  
- Training multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Confusion matrix
  - ROC curve and AUC score  
- Visual comparison of model performances using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- Python   
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Plotly  
- Scikit-learn  

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amenzbedi22/ML-Model-Comparison.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ML-Model-Comparison 
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
##🚀 Usage


Run the Jupyter notebook to explore and compare the models:
    
    jupyter notebook project.ipynb
Then execute the cells sequentially to Load and preprocess data
Train and evaluate multiple classifiers
Visualize results interactively


##📊 Results

Each model’s performance is evaluated and visualized to help identify which algorithm performs best for the given dataset.
